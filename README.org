* call_cnt
** what it is
   the purpose of libcall_cnt is to count the calls made by a shared
   ELF library through PLT mechanism
** what it is good for
   no idea, to be honest. i created it as a part of advanced operating
   course i was taking.
** usage
   sample usage is in testInterceptor.c, the library interface is
   obviously in call_cnt.h
** license
   do with it whatever you want, i'll be happy if you let me know that
   you find it interesting (i hope you do), or that you use it (wow,
   what for?)
